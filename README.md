WorkoutApp gives the user the ability to exercise for 7 minutes using 12 different exercises for 30 seconds and have a 10-seconds-break between them.
There is a Media Player that plays a sound every time an exercise is over and a TextToSpeech operator that tells you the name of every exercise once it is started.
Ath the bottom of the screen, there is a Recycler View that shows 12 numbers that are corresponed to the 12 exercises, so the user can get informed about
in which exercise he/she is currently doing, how many of them has already done and how many are left.
If the user wishes to stop working out, an alert dialog will pop out just to make sure he/she wants to leave or the desicion was a missclick.
The application contains a record (room database) where the user can get informed about all the times he/she exercised.
Moreover, there is a body mass index (BMI) where the user can calculate the BMI with kg/cm or inch/feet.
